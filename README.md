# active-directory-lab
Simulated Active Directory environment using Windows Server 2022 and VirtualBox
Configured a dual-NIC setup to separate internet access (NAT) from internal domain traffic using a private subnet (172.168.0.0/24), ensuring secure and isolated domain communication.
Created administrative user accounts and configured Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS) for NAT-based internet access within the internal network.
Implemented DNS and DHCP services to facilitate domain name resolution and dynamic IP addressing within the internal network.
